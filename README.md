This project is a doctor assitant system that leverages the IBM Granite AI model to streamline medical office operations. It allows patients to book appointments, provide medical restrictions, and receive pre-appointment instructions. For doctors, it offers a portal to view patient summaries, record and summarize conversations, and generate patient handouts or referral letters. The system uses a mock Employe health records for testing and integrates AI for efficiency.

Key features include:

Patient Interaction: Book appointments, ask for restrictions (using AI agent for grounded results), and provide do's and don'ts.
Doctor's Portal: View patient summaries, record conversations, transcibe them, write notes, and generate SOAP handouts or referral letters from AI-summarized data.
