## Mediscribe
This project is a doctor receptionist system that leverages the IBM Granite AI model to streamline medical office operations. It allows patients to book appointments, provide medical restrictions, and receive pre-appointment instructions. For doctors, it offers a portal to view patient summaries, record and summarize conversations, and generate patient handouts or referral letters. The system uses a mock EHR dataset (like MIMIC2) for testing and integrates AI for efficiency.

Key features include:

Patient Interaction: Book appointments, ask for restrictions, and provide do's and don'ts.
EHR Data Management: Fetch and summarize patient records.
Doctor's Portal: View patient summaries, record conversations, write notes, and generate handouts or referral letters from AI-summarized data.
